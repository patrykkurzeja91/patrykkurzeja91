My name is Patrick and I am a JavaScript developer. I used to be a civil engineer but decided to change my career... and here I am, creating websites and apps in Vue and React!

I love learning new things (even those not connected to programming), sports (football, snowboarding, wall climbing, crossfit), fantasy and crime books, playing video games and of course speciality coffee and craft beers.

Besides:
